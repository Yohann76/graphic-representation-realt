# Calcul invest return

The aim in version 2 or 3 is to calculate the return on investment for each property and therefore for the portfolio.

In the header I need to see +XX% reevaluation and +XX% rent receive +XX% total, for the entire portfolio.
in the property info table, I'd like to have for each property +XX% reevaluation and +XX% rent receive = +XX% total

V3 : calculate only on tokens owned (not sold)
V4 : integrate bought and sold tokens

### need data :

Time of sale (YAM, realT) (in blockchain)
